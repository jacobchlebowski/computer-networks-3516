6) Packet #1 consists of 5 layered protocols because
they all have a specific role that contributes to sending the packet
from a source to its final destination. Some of the layered
protocols are encapsulated. Encapsulation is good for protocols for
each layer that specify what to do with a file/object. Here are the layers
(Application, Transport, Network, Data-Link, Physical), and their
specific roles:

Domain Name System(Application): specifices shared communications protocols (ex: messages, or HTTP, or SMTP, FTP, etc.) 
Internet Protocol Version 4(Transport): provides reliable process to process in message delivery/error in delivery
User Datagram Protocol(Network): Moves packets from source to destination
Ethernet II(Data-Link): organize bits into frames, hop-to-hop delivery
Frame1-Copper Wire(Physical): transmits bits over a medium

Note: Each layer below encapsulates the layer above (ex: the transport layer contains the message (application header)...
