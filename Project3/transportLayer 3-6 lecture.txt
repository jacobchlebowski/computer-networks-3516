What is pipelining?
Go-Back-N vs. Selective Repeat


Go-Back-N:
-sender can have up to N UnACKed packets in pipeline
-receiver only sends CUULATIVE ACK
-sender has timer for oldest unACKED packet (when timer expires, retransmit ALL unACKED packets)

Selective-Repeat:
-sender can have i[ to N unACK'ed packets in pipeline
-rcvr sends INDIVIDUAL ACK for each packet
-sender maintains TIMER For each unACKED packet(when timer expires, retransmit ONLY that unACKED packet)
